# Predicting-Airline-Ticket-Prices-using-Expedia-Flight-Data
#This data includes prices of tickets found on Expedia between April 2022 to October 2022. These purchasable tickets are available from flights to and from several U.S #airports. The data includes a range of variables describing the flights, such as flight times, fare types, and ticket prices. Given this dataset I will be able to #predict the total fare based on various factors such as the departure and arrival airports, travel duration, airline, seat availability, and cabin type. I plan to use #linear regression model as the first approach to predict the ticket prices. This prediction model will help consumers find the best flights and airlines to pick their #dream vacation!
